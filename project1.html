     <li>Background</li><p>The sport of cricket has a known history beginning in the late 16th century England. It became an established sport in the country in the 18th century and developed globally in the<u> 19th and 20th centuries</u>. International matches have been played since the 19th-century and formal Test cricket matches are considered to date from 1877. Cricket is the world's second most popular spectator sport, after association football (soccer)</p>
                <li>Foundation</li><p>The foundation of a cricket team involves several key aspects: establishing a governing body, defining player roles and responsibilities, and fostering a positive team environment. The governing body, like the BCCI in India, sets rules, organizes matches, and manages the overall structure of the sport.</p>
                <li>Expansion and termination</li><p>Cricket has seen both expansion and termination of teams at various levels, including international and domestic leagues. Expansion, like the addition of new teams to Major League Cricket and the Indian Premier League, often involves introducing the sport to new regions and increasing competition</p>

    <li><b><i>Organisation</i></b></li>
    <p>The Indian Premier League, popularly knows as IPL, is a men's T20 cricket league, organized by the Board of Control for Cricket in India, the national governing body of cricket in India. T20 cricket is a shorter format of the game, with each team playing a single innings of 20 overs</p>
    <center><img src="ipl.png"height="270"width="400"></center>
    <ol type="i"> 
    <li>Tournament format</li><p>Each team played twice against the teams in their group and the team in the same row in the other group, and once against the remaining four teams in the other group. After the group stage, the top four teams, based on aggregate points, would advance to the playoffs.[3] In this stage, the top two teams compete with each other (in a match titled "Qualifier 1"), as does the remaining two teams (in a match titled "Eliminator"). </p>
    <li>Player acquisition, squad composition and salaries</li><p>IPL teams acquire players through a combination of auctions, trades, and retentions, forming their squads with a specific salary cap in mind. Players are bought for a season, with salaries determined during the auction or through negotiations during trades. Each team has a purse of money to spend on players, and the final squad composition is based on strategic bidding and player availability. </p>
    <li>Match rules</li><p>IPL (Indian Premier League) matches have specific rules and regulations that govern gameplay, player conduct, and matchday procedures. Key rules include television timeouts, the Decision Review System (DRS), and the "impact player" substitute. There are also regulations regarding player behavior, equipment, and dress code for post-match presentations. </p>
    <li>Prize money</li><p>Over the years, the IPL prize money has grown exponentially; DDCA wins 'Best Pitch and Ground' award. Newly crowned IPL champions Royal Challengers Bengaluru have received ‚Çπ20 crore for winning the 18th edition of the league while runners-up Punjab Kings got richer by ‚Çπ12.5 crore.4 Jun 2025</p>

    <li>Timeline</li><p>The Indian Premier League 2025 is set to return after being abruptly suspended by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) due to the conflict between India and Pakistan.

The last one week saw the Punjab Kings versus Delhi Capitals IPL 2025 being put on hold, followed by the league‚Äôs suspension, then players being evacuated from Dharamsala via a specially arranged train, to players returning to their homes.</p>
